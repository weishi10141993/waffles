    # Waveform for a certain channel could be analyzed so as 
    # to compute its baseline, but its timestamp is not defined,

    Attributes
    ----------
    time_step_ns: float
        The time step (in nanoseconds) for this Waveform
    adcs: unidimensional numpy array of integers/floats
        The readout for this Waveform, in # of ADCs
    time_offset: int
        A time offset, in units of time_step_ns (i.e.
        time ticks) which will be used as a relative
        alignment among different WaveformAdcs
        objects for plotting and analysis purposes.

        len(self.__adcs)-1. It is set to 0 by default.

        input_parameters: IPDict

            analysis_class initializer. It is the user's
            responsibility to ensure that input_parameters

        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments which are given

        N.B.: It is preferred to keep track of all of the I/O

        are designed for that purpose, i.e. WfAna.input_parameters
