class WaveformSet:
    """This class implements a set of waveforms.

    Attributes
    ----------
    waveforms: list of Waveform objects
        waveforms[i] gives the i-th Waveform in the set.
    points_per_wf: int
        Number of entries for the adcs attribute of
        each Waveform object in this WaveformSet object.
    runs: set of int
        It contains the run number of any run for which
        there is at least one Waveform in the set.
    record_numbers: dictionary of sets
        It is a dictionary whose keys are runs (int) and
        its values are sets of record numbers (set of int).
        If there is at least one Waveform object within
        this WaveformSet which was acquired during run n,
        then n belongs to record_numbers.keys(). record_numbers[n]
        is a set of record numbers for run n. If there is at
        least one Waveform acquired during run n whose
        record_number is m, then m belongs to record_numbers[n].
    available_channels: dictionary of dictionaries of sets
        It is a dictionary whose keys are run numbers (int),
        so that if there is at least one Waveform in the set
        which was acquired during run n, then n belongs to
        available_channels.keys(). available_channels[n] is a
        dictionary whose keys are endpoints (int) and its
        values are sets of channels (set of int). If there
        is at least one Waveform object within this WaveformSet
        which was acquired during run n and which comes from
        endpoint m, then m belongs to available_channels[n].keys().
        available_channels[n][m] is a set of channels for
        endpoint m during run n. If there is at least one
        Waveform for run n, endpoint m and channel p, then p
        belongs to available_channels[n][m].
    mean_adcs: WaveformAdcs
        The mean of the adcs arrays for every Waveform
        or a subset of waveforms in this WaveformSet. It
        is a WaveformAdcs object whose time_step_ns
        attribute is assumed to match that of the first
        Waveform which was used in the average sum.
        Its adcs attribute contains points_per_wf entries,
        so that mean_adcs.adcs[i] is the mean of
        self.waveforms[j].adcs[i] for every value
        of j or a subset of values of j, within
        [0, len(self.__waveforms) - 1]. It is not
        computed by default. I.e. if self.mean_adcs
        equals to None, it should be interpreted as
        unavailable data. Call the 'compute_mean_waveform'
        method of this WaveformSet to compute it.
    mean_adcs_idcs: tuple of int
        It is a tuple of integers which contains the indices
        of the waveforms, with respect to this WaveformSet,
        which were used to compute the mean_adcs.adcs
        attribute. By default, it is None. I.e. if
        self.mean_adcs_idcs equals to None, it should be
        interpreted as unavailable data. Call the
        'compute_mean_waveform' method of this WaveformSet
        to compute it.

        wf_idcs: list of int
            If it is not None, then it must be a list

            value for the __waveforms attribute of this

            list must satisfy
            0 <= i <= len(self.__waveforms) - 1. Any
            integer which does not satisfy this condition
            is ignored. These integers give the waveforms
            which are averaged.
        wf_selector: callable
            This parameter only makes a difference if
            the 'wf_idcs' parameter is None. If that's
            the case, and 'wf_selector' is not None, then
            it must be a callable whose first parameter
            must be called 'waveform' and its type
            annotation must match the Waveform class.
            Its return value must be annotated as a

            which wf_selector(wf, *args, **kwargs)
            evaluates to True.
        *kwargs
            These keyword arguments only make a
            difference if the 'wf_idcs' parameter is
            None and the 'wf_selector' parameter is
            suitable defined. For each Waveform, wf,

            given to the 'wf_filter' parameter of this
